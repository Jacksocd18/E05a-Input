# E05-Input

This is a game I edited for an exercise  created to help me get used to how Godot treats user input. 
This game has a normal plain space background and you can determine the coordinates of the mouse in the top left corner. 
You can also control the ship with the W,A,S,D keys to move it up, left, down, and right.
